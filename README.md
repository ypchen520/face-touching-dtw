# Face Touching Detection

- This repository contains the implementation for face touching activity recognition using dynamic time warping (DTW).
- This project is a collaboration with the [GeronTechnology Lab](https://aging-gtlab.sites.medinfo.ufl.edu/) directed by [Dr. Mamoun T. Mardini](https://hobi.med.ufl.edu/profile/mardini-mamoun/) in the Department of Health Outcomes and Biomedical Informatics supported by the UF Informatics Institute (UFII) COVID-19 Response SEED Program.
- I’m pleased to share that our [paper](./face-touching.pdf) was accepted to [ACM ICMI 2021](https://icmi.acm.org/2021/) as a Late-Breaking Results. Here is my [pre-recorded talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVyrVo46oEA). I’m grateful for the opportunity to share our work virtually at the ICMI 2021 conference:
