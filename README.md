# Face Touching Detection

- This project focuses on face touching activity recognition using dynamic time warping (DTW).
- This project is a collaboration with the GeronTechnology Lab directed by Dr. Mamoun T. Mardini in the Department of Health Outcomes and Biomedical Informatics supported by the UF Informatics Institute (UFII) COVID-19 Response SEED Program.
- I’m pleased to share that our [paper](./face-touching.pdf) was accepted to ACM ICMI 2021 as a Late-Breaking Results. I’m grateful for the opportunity to share our work virtually at the ICMI 2021 conference:
